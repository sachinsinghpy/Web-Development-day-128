Dynamic Routes in next.js
Dynamic routing is a core feature in modern web frameworks, enabling applications to handle variable paths based on user input or dynamic content. In Next.js 13+, with the introduction of the App Router, dynamic routes are implemented using a folder-based structure inside the app directory.

This article provides a step-by-step guide to implementing dynamic routes using the latest App Router approach, replacing the legacy pages directory system.

What Are Dynamic Route Segments?
Dynamic route segments allow developers to define routes that adapt to variable content. For instance, a blog platform might use URLs like /post/123 or /post/my-article. The segment (123, my-article) is dynamic and handled by bracket syntax:

app/post/[id]/page.js
With this structure, any value in place of [id] is captured and made available via the routing API.
